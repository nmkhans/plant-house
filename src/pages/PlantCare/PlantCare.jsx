                Plants based on your light
              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">
                Our #1 rule is to determine the amount of natural lightyour
                space receives, and to choose your plant accordingly. If you are
                not sure just by looking, start by figuring out which direction
                your windows face. Generally speaking, south-facing windows give
                bright light, east & west-facing windows give moderate light,
                and north-facing windows give low light. If there is something
                outside your window , for example, a large tree or building that
                could obstruct sunlight, make sure to take that into
                consideration, too. Most houseplants prefer bright, indirect
                sunlight, but many can tolerate lower light levels (like low
                light tolerant snake plants). If the sun is intense through your
                windows, you may want to add a sheer curtain to diffuse the
                light. Cacti and some succulents like aloe can handle brighter,
                direct sunlight. You do not want to overexpose or underexpose
                any plant so keep an eye on them if they're in very bright or
                very low light.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">
                a busy life and general forgetfulness can lead to unintentional
                plant neglect. It is okay. Some plants can handle that kind of
                lifestyle. A jetsetter like yourself will enjoy the resilience
                of low-maintenance and drought-tolerant succulents, all pretty
                low key, as long as they have enough light (bright and low light
                respectively). These should keep looking their best when you
                return from your next trip. If you have got more time, you can
                try a few attention-loving air plants, orchids, or ferns. Like a
                mist for the face, an extra spritz of filtered water daily
                between waterings keeps humidity levels nice and balanced for
                these delicate plants

                Be mindful when watering
              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">
                It is better to under water your plants than to overwater. Too
                much water can lead to root rot. Ditch your watering schedule
                and water your plant only when it needs it. Check the potting
                mix or soil first to make sure it is dry at least 2 inches deep
                below the surface. If your soil looks dark in color, feels
                moist, and sticks to your finger, your plant has enough water to
                do it is thing for now. How often you water will also change
                throughout the year. Plants need less water in the winter
                months, when they are growing slower, the days are shorter and
                sunlight is less intense. If the heat is on and their soil is
                drying out quicker, they may need a bit more water. Wilting
                leaves or soil that looks pulled away from the sides of the
                planter are signs of a thirsty plant. Always use warm water
                because it absorbs best. Pour water directly on the soil around
                the base of the plant, because plants absorb water from their
                roots. The only exception here is Epiphytes, like air plants,
                who absorb water through their leaves. You can also place a
                saucer under your planter, if it has a drainage hole. After you
                water, let your plant soak up in access water that fills the
                saucer for a few hours before emptying it.

                Know when to skip the fertilizer
              </h3>
              <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">
                Be mindful when using fertilizer on your houseplants. Too much
                fertilizer can do more harm than good. Houseplants tend to not
                need fertilizer as often as outdoor plants do. If you do choose
                to fertilize your plant, it is best to do so during the growing
                season (early spring to early fall) and follow the general rule
                of thumb:less is more. Most store bought fertilizers should be
                diluted with water before use. If you have had your plant for at
                least year, you can fertilize it for the first time. We suggest
                using an all-purpose fertilizer. Always follow the instructions.
                If you have just changed the soil, skip the fertilizer! Fresh
                soil has enough new nutrients.

              <p className="text-sm text-slate-600">
                If you tend to have a heavy hand when watering your plants, keep
                drainage in mind. You can opt for a planter with a drainage hole
                and saucer, keep your plant in a grow pot nestled inside a
                planter, or add lava rocks to the bottom of a planter without a
                hole (to create crevices for excess water to flow to). Do what
                works best for you! Do not be afraid to try different methods
                for different plants.
